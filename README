== Install

The main components to install are the perl packages, PostgreSQL database
setup and config script and the actual linz_asp_uploader programme and
configuration. The build install process handles this, however setup of the
PostgreSQL user account, database, logging directory and configuration setup need
to be done as manual task afterward.

-- Simple install

    perl Build.PL
    ./build install
    
-- Advanced install options

The build system is using perl Module::Build. A full list of the building
options are available run:

    ./build help
    
A more complex example involving specific install directories could something
like:

    perl Build.PL --prefix=/usr/local
    ./build install
or:

    perl Build.PL \
        --prefix=/usr \
        --install_path conf=/my/conf/dir \
        --install_path sql=/my/sql/dir

== Configuration

All parameters to setup and running of linz_asp_uploader can be found within the
template conf file in conf/linz_asp_uploader.conf. Another important file is
tables.conf which lists the ASP tables and their associated loading parameters.

Key parameters to change in the linz_asp_uploader.conf config are:

    asp_data_url: the url to the ASP zip file archive that is updated on the
    linz website.

    tmp_base_dir: This temp processing directory for downloading, uncompressing
    and pre-processing ASP datafiles.

    include_tables: A list of table to load for the run. These table must exist
    in the in the file as defined by asp_tables_config (tables.conf by defualt)

    smtpserver and smtpsender: The mail host and sender email address to send
    completion or error reports to.

    log_email_address: The email address ro addressed that the mail server will
    send the completion or error reports to. multiple emails can be listing with
    a "," separator.
    

== Running linz_asp_uploader

A simple example to upload all available asp files into the database is:
